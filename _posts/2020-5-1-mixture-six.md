  Mixture Six was a lifestyle blog based in the cultural mecha of Fitzroy, Melbourne.
</p>
<p>
  It was created by my High School pals Jess Johnson and Laura Mowat. We built
  mixture six together. I was the IT consultant and site maintainer. 
</p>
<p>
  The site was based on six categories: music, art & design, people, food, wellbeing and travel.
</p>
<p>
  Each week would produce a new mixtape of six hot tracks curated by our very own. This
  generally included local artists as well as international.
</p>
<p>
  Articles were written by Jess and her friends on some of the hottest things in Melbourne.
</p>
<p>
  The website was designed by Laura Mowat, built by Grafik, tweaked and maintained by myself.
