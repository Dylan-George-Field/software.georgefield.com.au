The second freelance job I did for $500 for family before completing university was this
site for my sister's small business start-up.
</p>
<p>
I did this at a low cost out of love. It's a basic Wordpress blog with a custom template
designed by myself and fully responsive by hand. Impressive for a time before bootstrapped grids and flexboxes.
</p>
<p>
The parent/child hierarchy of pages was perfect to list the layers of categories of rental items they supply. The blog feature also came in handy too.
</p>
<p>
While a better solution can be made with Shopify or other store plugins like WooCommerce. This worked out nicely as a pop-up solution before the business found its feet. 
</p>
<p>
Its been up for over 7 years and is key to their business.

Pretty good for a grad with little experience.
