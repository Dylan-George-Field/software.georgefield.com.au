This was my first website and it was a cracker!
</p>
<p>
An experimental single-page application before frameworks were cool. It loaded full screen images with a fade to black transition between pages and these funky menu items that
would move up and down in a 'swoosh'. Content for pages was loaded with ajax and it was totally the future.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, it didn't work on mobile at all and Google absolutely hated it! It got zero traffic and I had to move to a more traditional Wordpress site.

<p>
For shame...
