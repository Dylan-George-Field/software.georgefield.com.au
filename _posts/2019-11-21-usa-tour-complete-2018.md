I travelled 35,000km over 89-days to see as much of North America as I could.
Most nights I camped, 10 in cheap hotels and a few with friends or strangers. 
The USA is a naturally diverse place like its people. I enjoyed every minute of it.

I organised a DR650 through 'the famous' James Tucker. I met him on advrider. He purchased,
prepared and registered the bike under my name before I arrived. You only need a passport number to register a vehicle in California. He even offers mechanical service including modifications. I simply flew to Los Angeles, got to his house, stayed the night and rode off
the next day.

I got an unlimited AT&T sim card (works in Canada) and Google Maps my way around. I used 
https://freecampsites.net/ to find places to stay for free for 70 of the 90-days.

I sold my the motorbike privately in Los Angeles.
