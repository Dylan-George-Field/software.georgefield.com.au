  My dedicated adventure website for my overland world travels.
</p>
<p>
  I separated my software site and adventures as they have different goals and audiences. This one was made to document my Melbourne to London adventure by motorbike. It includes maps, budgets, vehicles and previous trips for to give back to the adventure community that's helped me so much. 
</p>
<p>
  The site is built on the same GitHub pages, Jekyll blog and template as this one. The intention is to be easy to update, free and last forever. This is important as world trips are expensive and you need an easy way to blog while on the road.

  The names under the logo are the two riders who passed while crossing Australia on a ride I was supposed to be on.
