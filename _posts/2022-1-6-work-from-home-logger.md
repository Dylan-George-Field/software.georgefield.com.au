A windows app to log work from home hours for the Australian Tax Office (ATO).

It logs every hour based on your network. If it's in the saved list of 'home networks'. It will log that you're working from home.

This is a requirement from the ATO. They require at leased 4 weeks worth of logs to claim work from home expenses. This is a handy tool for
the unlikely event that you get audited. Simply set and forget. You'll be covered before you know it!

A .net wpf app. Please find the download links below.
