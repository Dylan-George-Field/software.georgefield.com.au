I built this in two days according to my old website.
</p>
<p>
This is 1 of 3 sites I did in conjunction with my sister, Erin. The were quick and dirty jobs using a combination of Wordpress and purchased themes.

The turnaround time was surprisingly fast. I probably only got $250 bucks for it.

The pictures are stunning. It's a lovely place. I stayed there with my family. I broke up with my girlfriend on the first night and we had to drive home at 2am in the morning.

Awkward.
