# Software Developer Survival Guide üèï
A guide to get you started working in Melbourne, Australia.
## Welcome to Melbourne
Melbourne is wonderful. It's the cultural hub of Australia and is filled with events, arts, sports, nightlife and a vibrant software community. The city centre is called the CBD or 'central business district'. It's located on the Yarra river and will be your first point of interest.

## Introduction
Melbourne is a multicultural city. People value freedom and the 'fair go'. That is, freedom of speech, religion and expression. People like to be treated fairly and are a hard-working and trustworthy bunch. Discrimination, racism and intolerance is not allowed, although you may experience the odd 'quip'. We live a happy life free of most corruption and generally trust the government.

### Weather
The weather is known to be temperamental. One moment it's sunny, the next it's windy and rainy.  Summer can bring extreme heat and it will follow with a storm. This heat brings bushfire and can cause a smokey haze to blanket the city. Winter is chilly but no snow as we're at sea-level.

Temperatures range from 25-35C in Summer and 5-15C in Winter.

### What to pack 
You need a combination of clothes to get you through the seasons. Many workplaces have a smart casual dress code. Note that Australian electricity plugs are unique and look like this: / \

| Type        | Clothes                     |
|------------ |-----------------------------|
| Summer      | Dress/Skirt/Tank-top        |
| Winter      | Coat/Pants/Woolly Socks     |
| Business    | Smart Casual/Suit if unsure |

## Getting Around
The city isn't huge. It's spread out over about 30km. You need to work out the best transport method for you and where you stay. Most people have cars.
### From the Airport
There are two airports, Avalon or Tullamarine. Both have a public bus service called [Skybus](https://www.skybus.com.au/).

| Airport      | Destination            | Distance |  Bus  | Uber  |
|--------------|------------------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Avalon       | Southern Cross Station | 1 hour   |  $25  |  $80  |
| Tullamarine  | Southern Cross Station | 30 min   |  $20  |  $40  |

### Public Transport
You need a [Myki card](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki). It's a pre-paid card you can get from a station or ticket machine. You must tap it 'on' and tap it 'off' when you disembark. You'll get fined if you don't have a valid one. Full fare is about $7 a day and cheaper for students.

The network is confusing. Ask the staff for help to get to your destination.

#### Trams
Are free in the CBD! They follow set routes and are great to get around short distances.

#### Trains
All of them go to the CBD and do a 'city loop'. It's the fastest way to outer suburbs.

The main city stations are:
- Flinders St Station
- Southern Cross
- Melbourne Central Station 

Trains run 24 hours on weekends.

#### Buses
You'll find these anywhere there's no rail.

### Bicycle
Bikes are the best if you work in the city and live within 10km of it. They're a cheap, clean and somewhat unsafe mode of transport. You can get a bike off Facebook Marketplace for $150. You must wear a helmet.

Beware of tram tracks.
### Car/Motorbike
A valid license and registration are required from [Victroads](https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/).

A car or motorbike can be obtained from:
- Facebook Marketplace
- [Carsales](https://www.carsales.com.au/)
- [Bikesales](https://www.bikesales.com.au/)

## Where to Stay
Housing is more expensive the closer you are to the city. A controversial rule is the best suburbs are on the South-East side of the bay and generally degrade running counter-clockwise in a circle around the CBD.

### Locations
Inner-city suburbs are recommended for singles within 10km of the CBD and further out if you have a family.

| Suburb              | Lifestyle                             | 
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| CBD                 | Newcomers, small rooms, convenient    |
| Docklands           | New apartments, windy, no atmosphere  | 
| Richmond            | Football, sports types, grassroots    |
| South Yarra         | Fashion, party                        |
| Fitzroy             | Hip, music, arts                     |
| North Melbourne     | Left-wing                             |
| South Melbourne     | Right-wing                            |
| St. Kilda           | All sorts, Beach, vibes               |
| Footscray           | Rough and Tumble                      |
| Everything else     | Suburbia                              |
