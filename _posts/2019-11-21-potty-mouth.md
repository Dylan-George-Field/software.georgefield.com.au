Potty Mouth is a digital graffiti wall. Scan the image and get access to a secret wall to leave messages. It's inspired by those words of wisdom you see on the back of a toilet door in a dirty club or bar.

This pet project is built with a friend of mine, Tama Waddell. He shared the concept while drinking a bottle of ginger goon on a park bench in St. Kilda early Sunday morning as the sun rose after a big night out. We bounced ideas and created Potty Mouth (formally TryScanMe).

The unique thing about it is you get locked out after a minute. This means there's not way back to the chat wall without being physically located to it. This could be a toilet, park bench, rooftop or hidden up a tree. This creates the unique pot culture of SUPER PHYSICALLY RIGHT HERE people.

<p>
What they experience, smell, fear or love about it can be expressed in text or photo form. It may not sound like much but the results are entertaining and unified.

I love Potty Mouth. It's the most unique thing I've ever made and I hope, thanks to the wonders of azure function consumption plans and scaling, will last forever.
