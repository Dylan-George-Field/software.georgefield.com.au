The first freelance job I got when I was at university. A friend of mine asked me to update
their existing site. 
</p>
<p>
They had an aging site and asked me if I could spruce it up. The brief was to make it look 'professional'. I did a great job at the time. I can't remember why it never went live. I don't think it was a big improvement on the original.
</p>
<p>
It included jquery animations, google maps address auto-suggest, date-picker and cool validation flags on quote input fields. I was proud, it must've been 2010.
</p>
<p>
It still exists, oddly as a 'test' site. I think Rowan forgot about it.
