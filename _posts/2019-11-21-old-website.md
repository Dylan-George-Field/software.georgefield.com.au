This was my first website and it was a cracker!
</p>
<p>
It was an experimental single-page application before frameworks were cool. It loaded full screen images with a fade to black transition between pages and these funky menu items that
would move up and down in a 'swish' way. Content for pages was loaded with ajax. It was totally the future.
</p>
<p>
The problem was, it didn't work on mobile at all and Google absolutely hated it! Unfortunately, it got zero traffic as a result and I had to move to a more traditional Wordpress site.

<p>
For shame...
