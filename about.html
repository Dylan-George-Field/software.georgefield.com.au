	<h2>Mission</h2>

	<p>To inspire you to see the world by motorbike.</p>

	<h2>Who</h2>

	<p>I grew up on a farm in Sale, Victoria. My dad (pictured below) taught us how to ride when we were kids.
		We rode trails on weekends while camping in the bush. I'm not an expert rider. Just someone
		who enjoys the thrill of adventure.
	</p>

	<h2>Media</h2>
	<p>I love to work with others and promote adventure riding. If you need a story, inspirational speaker or help planning
	your next adventure, <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
