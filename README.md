# Adventure Site

Based on the Treat template for Jekyll.

## Setup

1. Site details in including Google Analytics/Disqus in `_config.yml`.
3. Author details in `_data/sidebar.yml`

## Develop

Treat was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.4.3, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~
